But if the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS)&nbsp;had won their case against <a href=# rel=nofollow>Emily Hunt</a>, it would have been.</p><p>Under current voyeurism legislation, it’s an offence to record someone doing a private act -&nbsp;without their consent - in a place which might reasonably be expected to be private. On this basis several police forces have charged and tried defendants for taking secret videos during sexual activity.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s all the more baffling, then, that the CPS refused to charge Emily Hunt’s attacker.&nbsp;</p><p>Emily has waived her right to anonymity and told her story extensively. She believes she was drugged: she had a boozy lunch, an inexplicable blackout, and woke up, hours later, naked in a hotel room with a complete stranger. It’s a nightmare scenario, compounded when she was denied justice.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the defendant maintains that they had consensual sex, video footage showed Emily so intoxicated she could barely stand. But the CPS said there was insufficient evidence to charge for rape. The defendant told the police that when Emily passed out, he masturbated onto her leg; the CPS didn’t consider this a<a href=#> sexual assault</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps worst of all, he took a video of her sleeping naked, and admitted that she had not consented. Astonishingly, the CPS did not see this as a voyeurism offence.&nbsp;</p><p>The Centre for Women’s Justice (CWJ) helped Emily judicially review the decision not to prosecute for voyeurism. We argued that the CPS’s legal logic was wrong: in fact, it was egregious.</p><p>CPS lawyers said they could not prove that Emily had been raped or drugged, so they had to assume that she was in the hotel room having sex consensually. As a result, they said, Emily&nbsp;must have consented to being viewed naked and, by extension, to being filmed. Legally, they argued she didn’t have a reasonable expectation of privacy, and so no voyeurism offence had been committed.&nbsp;</p><p>This tortuous argument leads to absurd results.</p><p>It skirts around the fundamental difference between observing someone during a sexual encounter, and secretly filming them afterwards. It rides roughshod over an individual’s right to privacy, and ignores the unique permanence and harm of non-consensual videos for the women who are victimised by them.&nbsp;</p><p>It also adds insult to injury by implicating Emily in the offence, positing that by ‘consenting’ to being naked in the room she had somehow consented to being filmed in whatever way the defendant chose, while she slept. This, despite the fact that she maintains she was raped.&nbsp;</p><p>This was a dangerous and misconstrued argument, which the CPS never should have made. Its risks for the victims of voyeurism offences were perfectly demonstrated on Tuesday this week&nbsp;when, less than two weeks before Emily’s hearing, we at the CWJ discovered that the CPS were about to defend a different case&nbsp;using Emily’s own arguments.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Tony Richards</a>, whose case was heard in the Court of Appeal on Tuesday, filmed several women during sex without their knowledge or consent. His lawyers argued that the women were consenting to being observed by him during sex, and therefore there was no protection under the criminal law from being filmed by him.&nbsp;</p><p>In his defence, Richards was essentially using the same reasoning the CPS used to justify their refusal to prosecute&nbsp;in Emily Hunt’s case. And the CPS opposed his appeal, for reasons very similar to the ones Emily was due to put forwards just over a week later against them.</p><p>It is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the disparity in policy between the two cases. The CPS has a duty as a public body to act consistently and in the public interest. If they were aware that they were making opposite arguments barely two weeks apart, they should never have opposed Emily’s judicial review. If they were not, this episode is an indictment of their incoherent position on sexual offences.&nbsp;</p><p>CWJ was granted permission to urgently intervene in Richards’s&nbsp;case on behalf of Emily Hunt. Interventions like this are rarely allowed in criminal appeals, and this one gave Emily the chance to be heard. Richards’s arguments were given short shrift by the Court of Appeal, who confirmed that it is an offence to film someone in this way.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, the CPS has been forced to review their decision not to prosecute Emily’s attacker. It’s a decision she has fought for five years. Her case is a shameful example of the uphill battle complainants often face in their pursuit of justice for sexual crimes.&nbsp;</p><p>If the CPS had won in Emily’s judicial review, they would have succeeding in limiting their own capacity to prosecute in cases such as Richards's. They would have - by their own arguments -&nbsp;made it lawful to film someone naked and asleep, or during sexual activity, without their consent.&nbsp;</p><p>Prosecution rates for serious sexual offences have plummeted by 52 per cent&nbsp;in two years, and <a href=#>CPS statistics released today</a> show a further significant drop in completed prosecutions. In this context, when confidence in the CPS is at an all-time low among&nbsp;women’s groups, their approach to Emily’s case was irresponsible.&nbsp;</p><p>This is yet another example of the increasingly risk-averse approach the CPS has taken in recent years, refusing to prosecute sexual offences despite persuasive evidence, and even admissions, by the defendant. Strikingly, in Emily’s case there were multiple possible offences that the CPS could have charged on the basis of the defendant’s admissions alone.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that they fought Emily at every step of an absurd judicial review, instead of bringing a charge, is testament to a worrying lack of ambition in the prosecution of sexual offences in Britain. CWJ hear regularly from complainants - and even police officers - concerned that the CPS’s bar has been set so high that even straightforward cases, such as voyeurism, struggle to make it before a jury.&nbsp;</p><p>So while it is cause for celebration that women now have protection under the criminal law from being filmed in private moments, this is a battle that Emily Hunt should not have had to fight at all.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaK%2BforKve8uinZ5nlp65rrXNoGSnmZuasW6%2Fy56cqaGenHq4u8yapWarla3CoriMoKmarJmbtqSt06Kmp2WepMRutculnKCZnGQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffilming-naked-sleeping-woman-sexual-gratification-now-illegal.html&text=Filming%20a%20naked%2c%20sleeping%20woman%20for%20sexual%20gratification%20is%20now%20illegal&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffilming-naked-sleeping-woman-sexual-gratification-now-illegal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffilming-naked-sleeping-woman-sexual-gratification-now-illegal.html&title=Filming%20a%20naked%2c%20sleeping%20woman%20for%20sexual%20gratification%20is%20now%20illegal" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffilming-naked-sleeping-woman-sexual-gratification-now-illegal.html&title=Filming%20a%20naked%2c%20sleeping%20woman%20for%20sexual%20gratification%20is%20now%20illegal" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffilming-naked-sleeping-woman-sexual-gratification-now-illegal.html&title=Filming%20a%20naked%2c%20sleeping%20woman%20for%20sexual%20gratification%20is%20now%20illegal" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffilming-naked-sleeping-woman-sexual-gratification-now-illegal.html&description=Filming%20a%20naked%2c%20sleeping%20woman%20for%20sexual%20gratification%20is%20now%20illegal" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gareth-gates-rare-photo-daughter-missy-grown-up.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gareth Gates shares incredibly rare photo of daughter Missy  and she is so grown up!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./697902-fans-asap-rocky-dissed-travis-scott-rolling-loud.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fans Think ASAP Rocky Dissed Travis Scott At Rolling Loud">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
