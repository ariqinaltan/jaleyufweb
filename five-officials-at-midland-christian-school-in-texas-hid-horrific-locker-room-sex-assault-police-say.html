It is important to us that every word and deed engaged in by Midland Christian School, its employees, representatives, volunteers, and students be consistent with and in furtherance of Midland Christian School’s religious purposes: both publicly and privately.”</p><p>But the five school officials apparently did not live up to those tenets following the alleged January attack, which was first exposed <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>by the Midland Reporter-Telegram</a>.</p><p>On Jan. 28, a detective with the Midland Police Department was notified about a “possible sexual assault of a child” that had occurred eight days earlier after baseball practice at Midland Christian.</p><p>In an interview with authorities, the unnamed victim said he had just stepped into the locker room to get changed when the lights were turned off. Someone said it was “freshman initiation day,” and a 10th-grader began hitting the ninth-grader.</p><p>The ninth-grader’s hands were pinned down, and he was flipped over onto his back, the affidavit states. He was then sexually assaulted with a baseball bat as other students looked on and cheered, it says.</p><p>The next day, the freshman student told school officials what had happened. And then, nothing.</p><p>“The two of them see each other every day as they are on the same baseball team,” the affidavit goes on.</p><p>On Feb. 11, police investigators showed up at Midland Christian and spoke with Ellis, the principal of the secondary school. She told cops that she was aware of the incident and that it had been documented. However, Ellis said Lee, the school superintendent, was the only one with access to the files.</p><p>When Ellis told Lee about the horrific incident, Lee ordered McClendon and Counts to “conduct an ‘investigation’ into the incident instead of notifying law enforcement or another state agency,” the affidavit explains.</p><p>But when Lee contacted police on Feb. 14, he refused to answer any questions or provide the documentation to which Ellis had referred, demanding that cops get a search warrant.</p><p>The warrant was granted and executed the same day.</p><p>During the search, investigators were given access to “notes” written by McClendon and Counts that documented the incident, according to the affidavit.</p><p>In emails between all five that were reviewed by police, “it was made very clear that a sexual assault had occurred, and the school had a duty to report,” the affidavit continues, noting that “there were multiple emails exchanged,” and that “several of the administrators refused to report the incident.”</p><p>The five were arrested Wednesday and released on $5,000 bond. It is still unclear whether they have retained lawyers to speak on their behalf.</p><p>On Thursday, <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>police arrested a student involved in the alleged attack</a>, authorities announced. No further details have been released, and the student, who is a juvenile, has not been identified.</p><p>“Our school officials have, and will continue to, cooperate with law enforcement and their investigation,” the president of Midland Christian’s board of trustees <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>told the Reporter-Telegram</a> in a statement. “Currently, we have qualified acting administrators to supervise the campus, oversee student activities, support faculty, and maintain the day-to-day operation of the school. The physical, spiritual, and emotional safety of our students is the most important responsibility we bear as educators and one we take seriously. We appreciate the support and prayers of our Midland Christian parents, faculty, staff, and students as we continue leading, building, and equipping for Christ.”</p><p>The allegations in the Midland Christian case are disturbingly similar to those laid out in a 2020 civil suit filed by a student at a public school in the Midland suburb of Greenwood. Administrators there stand accused of covering up repeated sexual assaults of a student athlete by his teammates, <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>according to court filings reviewed by The Daily Beast</a>, which say the school not only tried to sweep the alleged assaults under the rug, but that it retaliated by “discontinuing a longstanding business relationship” with the victim’s father. The <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial in September</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfm7a3sYyonZ%2Bhk56urb%2BMmqtmpZmZuaK6w2aaoaqZqMGqrc1mqpygn6S5brXNZquesJGoeqm1w2afqKqinrOqr4ylppyjlad6s7vOpmSsnahirrS%2FwK6jrWWgpLmqr8Rmqpqx</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffive-officials-at-midland-christian-school-in-texas-hid-horrific-locker-room-sex-assault-police-say.html&text=Five%20Officials%20at%20Midland%20Christian%20School%20in%20Texas%20Hid%20Horrific%20Locker%20Room%20Sex%20Assault%2c%20Police%20Say&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffive-officials-at-midland-christian-school-in-texas-hid-horrific-locker-room-sex-assault-police-say.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffive-officials-at-midland-christian-school-in-texas-hid-horrific-locker-room-sex-assault-police-say.html&title=Five%20Officials%20at%20Midland%20Christian%20School%20in%20Texas%20Hid%20Horrific%20Locker%20Room%20Sex%20Assault%2c%20Police%20Say" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffive-officials-at-midland-christian-school-in-texas-hid-horrific-locker-room-sex-assault-police-say.html&title=Five%20Officials%20at%20Midland%20Christian%20School%20in%20Texas%20Hid%20Horrific%20Locker%20Room%20Sex%20Assault%2c%20Police%20Say" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffive-officials-at-midland-christian-school-in-texas-hid-horrific-locker-room-sex-assault-police-say.html&title=Five%20Officials%20at%20Midland%20Christian%20School%20in%20Texas%20Hid%20Horrific%20Locker%20Room%20Sex%20Assault%2c%20Police%20Say" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffive-officials-at-midland-christian-school-in-texas-hid-horrific-locker-room-sex-assault-police-say.html&description=Five%20Officials%20at%20Midland%20Christian%20School%20in%20Texas%20Hid%20Horrific%20Locker%20Room%20Sex%20Assault%2c%20Police%20Say" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./freddie-prinze-jr-net-worth-2024-3.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Freddie Prinze Jr Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dule-hill-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dul Hill Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
