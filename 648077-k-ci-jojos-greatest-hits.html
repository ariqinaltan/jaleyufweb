Along with being the second single off their fourth studio album, Emotional, K-Ci and JoJo scored another slot on a movie soundtrack.&nbsp; Just like “Life” years prior, “This Very Moment” appeared on the soundtrack to the movie, Deliver Us From Eva.&nbsp; <a href=# rel>LL Cool J</a> and Gabrielle Union star in this romantic comedy. &nbsp; This single happened to be the last release for the X singers in 2002 until they came back over ten years later.&nbsp; In 2013, they released “Knock It Off”.&nbsp;</p><span><h2><strong>3. “Last Night’s Letter”</strong></h2></span><p>“Last Night’s Letter” is another wedding ballad for the Jodeci members.&nbsp; Just like “All My Life”, this song can be played during the first dance. It’s an appreciation song for the love of his life.&nbsp; Sometimes, that’s all you need to do, just let her know that you’re thinking of her.&nbsp; K-Ci & Jo-Jo showing us a letter will do the trick.&nbsp;</p><p>Before releasing their hit, “All My Life”, the brothers dropped “Last Night’s Letter”.&nbsp; It was the second single off their debut album, Love Always.&nbsp; On the Billboard R&B/Hip=Hop chart, the song reached number 15.</p><span><h2><strong>2. “Life”</strong></h2></span><p>The R&B duo made a song perfect for the prominent comedy flick, Life, starring Eddie Murphy and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Martin Lawrence</a>.&nbsp; Titled, “Life” as well, the lyrics are right in sync with the plot of the movie.&nbsp; K-CI & JoJo give their all in this performance as you can hear the pain in their voices while singing.&nbsp; It’s as if they really did get a life sentence.&nbsp; You can hear the sorrow as they tell their stories.</p><p>Although this is one of their best songs, the duo did not write it.&nbsp; In fact, <a href=# class=text-word rel>R. Kelly</a> wrote and produced the movie single.&nbsp; It was the first single off the Life soundtrack and first single off K-Ci & JoJo’s second studio album, It’s Real.&nbsp; “Life” peaked at number 60 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.&nbsp; It’s only right that they made a classic song into a classic movie.</p><span><h2><strong>1. "All My Life"</strong></h2></span><p>The perfect wedding song is what K-Ci and JoJo made with “All My Life”.&nbsp; Throughout the song, the duo sings powerful lyrics like “All my life I prayed for someone like you” and “Close to me you’re like my mother, close to me you’re like my father...”.&nbsp; The words in this song certainly scream love and unity.&nbsp; This is one of the best R&B ballads of all time.&nbsp; “All My Life” is a timeless record as this will be played for years to come.</p><p>“All My Life” is the duo’s best record as it topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart three weeks straight!&nbsp; It was nominated for Best R&B song as well as Best R & B Vocal Performance by a Duo Or Group at the 1999 Grammy Awards.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they lost to “Doo Wop (That Thing)” by <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lauryn Hill</a> and “The Boy Is Mine” by <a href=# class=text-word rel>Brandy</a> & Monica, respectively.&nbsp; The video was just as good as the song as it was nominated for Best R&B Video at the MTV Video Music Awards in 19998.&nbsp; Unfortunately, “Gone Till November” by <a href=# class=text-word rel>Wyclef Jean</a> beat them out.&nbsp; Although it did not win awards, the song is a certified classic and their best record.</p><p>Let us know your favorite K-Ci & JoJo song in the comments!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaYVxg5ZmomabmWK3sLbOrGSgqpWWwaa%2F02afoqyj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f648077-k-ci-jojos-greatest-hits.html&text=K-Ci%20%26amp%3b%20JoJo%27s%20Greatest%20Hits&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f648077-k-ci-jojos-greatest-hits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f648077-k-ci-jojos-greatest-hits.html&title=K-Ci%20%26amp%3b%20JoJo%27s%20Greatest%20Hits" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f648077-k-ci-jojos-greatest-hits.html&title=K-Ci%20%26amp%3b%20JoJo%27s%20Greatest%20Hits" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f648077-k-ci-jojos-greatest-hits.html&title=K-Ci%20%26amp%3b%20JoJo%27s%20Greatest%20Hits" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f648077-k-ci-jojos-greatest-hits.html&description=K-Ci%20%26amp%3b%20JoJo%27s%20Greatest%20Hits" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kate-moss-lila-moss-dior-show.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kate Moss and Her Daughter Lila Moss Look Identical In New Photographs">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./759762-ice-spice-spotify-party-hip-hop-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ice Spice Twerks In See-Through Striped Fit At Spotify's &amp;quot;Best New Artist&amp;quot; Party">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
