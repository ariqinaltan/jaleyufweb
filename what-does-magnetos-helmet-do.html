Telepathic Resistance/Immunity: The helmet protects its wearer from all but the strongest or most unexpected of telepathic attacks. This is achieved due to technology wired into the helmet itself.<h2>Is Magneto's helmet Vibranium?</h2>In the comic canon, Magneto's helmet is made out of whatever metals Magneto has available. Any strong metal appears to be usable.<h2>Can Magneto control his helmet?</h2>The only problem I have with this scene is that Magneto used the incredibly roundabout method of controlling a wire to remove the helmet when he could have simply removed the helmet directly with his power, and as we saw in X-Men: Days of Future Past, Magneto does in fact have the ability to control this helmet with ...<h2>How can Magneto levitate?</h2>Aside from making himself able to effectively fly, Magneto can manipulate the forces of gravity and magnetism for other objects and people. By creating a localized electromagnetic field with reversed polarity from the Earth's he can levitate massive objects and even other powerful mutants.<h2>How Magneto's Helmet Works</h2><p></p><h2>Can Magneto lift Mjolnir?</h2>Yes,magneto can control magnetic fields not metals. So Marvel had revealed that Magneto can lift Thor's hammer.<h2>Can Magneto move gold?</h2>Uru. Magneto can manipulate uru. It has two forms: gold, and almost like wrought iron. He is more than capable of manipulating the natural metal of uru.<h2>What is stronger Vibranium or Adamantium?</h2>While Adamantium is denser, it can still succumb to extreme heat, while Vibranium's only true weakness is sonic waves and itself. By lacking easily accessible counters, Vibranium easily takes the crown as the stronger metal.<h2>Who is an Omega level mutant?</h2>Omega Level Mutants are mutants whose dominant power is deemed to register, or reach, an undefinable upper limit of that power's specific classification.<h2>Why can't Jean use Cerebro?</h2>It is mentioned that Magneto helped Charles Xavier design Cerebro. Jean Grey attempted to use the device, but the input overwhelmed her nascent telepathic power and left her stunned.<h2>Why is Magneto's helmet different?</h2>The ornamental horns were now more integral to the overall design of the helmet, giving it a rather segmented look as the horned "mouth" area appeared to form something of a frontal frame. Magneto sported the helmet when he and the rest of The Brotherhood went to retrieve Rogue.<h2>Why does juggernaut have a helmet?</h2>Juggernaut's Helmet is a special form of headgear designed to protect the wearer from all forms of telepathy. He also wears a metal skull cap underneath the helmet made of the same metal as Magneto's helmet that blocks psi-energy.<h2>Why does Galactus wear a helmet?</h2>After fleeing from Uatu, Galactus prepared for his new life in the Marvel Universe. He constructed a new helmet and suit to "help him regulate his awesome abilities." This stabilization meant Galactus was such an intangible and powerful being without his helmet that his energy could destroy things beyond his control.<h2>Why does Magneto wear a cape?</h2>Taking inspiration from his teammate, Azazel, Magneto wore a button-less Nehru jacket, colored bright red in commemoration of the bloodshed of his people. Draped over this was a grey cloak which matched the grey trousers he wore underneath.<h2>Is Magneto stronger than apocalypse?</h2>1 Winner: Apocalypse<p>As powerful as Magneto is, Apocalypse hasn't lived this long by being stupid.</p><h2>Can Magneto read minds?</h2>In the Uncanny X-Men comics, Magneto was able to mount such a firm mental block while meditating that even Emma Frost couldn't read his mind while attempting to do so right in front of him.<h2>Who is a Class 5 mutant?</h2>Jean Grey was the only Class Five mutant ever met by Charles Xavier (which implies Magneto and Pyro are Class Four), and her potential was stated to be limitless. It is unknown if Callisto counted herself and the Omega Gang as Class Three or less, or among the Class Four.<h2>Is Xavier Omega level?</h2>Professor Charles Xavier was an Alpha-Level Mutant, an Omega Class Telepath, was said to possess the most powerful brain in existence, to be the world's greatest telepath, and possesses vast psionic powers.<h2>Is Cyclops A omega level?</h2>Cyclops is an original X-Man, the team's leader, and the headmaster of the Xavier institute on occasion. And none of these esteemed roles were given to Summers either - he had to earn them. Unlike his wife and firstborn son, Scott's not an Omega-Level mutant.<h2>What is mjolnir made of?</h2>For example, Marvel – which publishes the Thor comics – issued a “Thor's Hammer” trading card in 1991 that states Mjolnir is made of Uru and weighs precisely 42.3 pounds.<h2>Can Wolverine's claws cut Captain America's shield?</h2>Because without altering any continuities, if Fox's Wolverine and Marvel's Captain America were to come to blows, the claws would slice through the shield like a hot knife through butter. Vibranium can absorb kinetic energy, but it isn't indestructible (as evidenced by Thanos destroying the shield in Endgame).<h2>Can Wolverine regrow his claws?</h2>In The Wolverine, he regrows bone claws when they are cut off, reverting to his original anatomy. However, because his skeleton is made of adamantium-beta, which has adapted to fuse the metal with his biology he would actually most likely regrow them as adamantium.<h2>Can Magneto bend titanium?</h2>Most of the common metals used today, are magnetic to some degree. Iron, Aluminum, Copper, Titanium, Chromium, you name it. So having magnetic powers does give you power over most of metal-based objects.<h2>Does Magneto's powers work on vibranium?</h2>It is not so much that Magneto cannot affect vibranium, but that the metal's vibratory nature and energy-absorption components can be harnessed in such a way that the Master of Magnetism meets his match.<h2>Who is the most powerful mutant in Marvel?</h2>Franklin Richards is the most powerful mutant in the Marvel Universe.
