Really hard. Since my lash line completely disappears beneath my lids when I blink, the friction wears away at the glue, turning everything into one sticky glob. So when I saw magnetic lashes floating around my Instagram feed, I was intrigued. Fake lashes that eliminate eyelash glue from the equation entirely&nbsp;and&nbsp;stay on all day? All for the same price as a cup of coffee? I was skeptical—but intrigued.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://glamnetic.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fglamnetic.com%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fbeauty%2Fa30536150%2Fbest-magnetic-eyeliner-lashes" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - glamnetic.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined>Glamnetic’s</a> CEO and co-founder, Ann McFerran, explains that magnetic liners—on which you can layer the lashes of your dreams—have a two-for-one function. “Magnetic liners are special because you can use them as a normal eyeliner but they also double up when you are looking to add lashes on top,” she says.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-magnetic-lashes-and-liner><span>What to Look For in Magnetic Lashes and Liner</span></h2><p>Just like our favorite <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-eyeliners/>eyeliners</a>, magnetic liners are not all made equal. When shopping for a magnetic liner, you should first consider your preferred applicator and skill level. A felt-tip liner brush will give you more control, whereas a pen or marker tip liner is much more forgiving for beginners.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, texture is a big deal when it comes to the best magnetic liners. “Texture should be smooth and viscous enough that it doesn’t look watery or runny,” says McFerran. Lastly, McFerran recommends looking for liners that use clean ingredients and no parabens to avoid irritation.&nbsp;</p><p>As for magnetic lashes, it’s all a matter of personal preference. Are you going for a dramatic cat-eye? Chose a pair with fluttery length and volume. Looking for something more natural? Go for medium or short-length lashes made from silk or faux mink for a subtly glam look.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-our-review-of-magnetic-lashes><span>Our Review of Magnetic Lashes</span></h2><h2 id=ardell-magnetic-liner-amp-wispies-lash-kit-3>Ardell Magnetic Liner & Wispies Lash Kit</h2><p>When applying the liner, I noticed that the formula was a bit...gloopy? It skipped a lot and definitely didn't go on as smoothly as I'd hoped. As it clumped, I applied more and more liner to try to save the mess, which just made the line thicker. Eventually, I had to bust out my normal eyeliner to draw over the messy parts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VTPudv5xJkUhUwBut3Sj8K-1920-80.png><p>After I got the line down, I followed the instructions and applied two coats—allowing for drying time in between—but the lashes still didn’t stick very well. It was only after a third coat that the lashes stayed in place. Once they were on, though, the lashes were pretty good. They didn’t unstick at all until I took them off at the end of the day. So, despite the hassle, I would give this kit two thumbs up for longevity.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

They had to brave blood, sweat, and tears (okay, maybe not blood), and those strips still remained loyally attached to my lids for about 10 hours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wcPtpQvsy6ECguvvzkuoWX-1920-80.png><p>KISS's eyeliner brush is thin and the formula is really pigmented, so the application process was smooth. The lashes stuck instantly to the liner—one strip has five magnets, which meant that even after trimming it to fit my eye, it latched seamlessly. I did notice the liner got a bit crusty and flaky in some areas after a few hours, but nothing too noticeable. Plus, there was definitely no smudging (as the box promises). Overall, highly recommend.</p><p><strong>Hana's Rating: 9/10</strong></p><a href=# data-model-name="Kiss Magnetic Eyeliner & Lure Lash Kit" data-url=https://www.ulta.com/p/magnetic-eyeliner-lure-lash-kit-pimprod2014160 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fmagnetic-eyeliner-lure-lash-kit-pimprod2014160&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=ulta.com data-merchant-id=204095 data-merchant-url=ulta.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Af8DGQ6NBTReWXTrxZ6HkV-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Kiss Magnetic Eyeliner & Lure Lash Kit</p><h2 id=eylure-promagnetic-magnetic-eyeliner-amp-faux-mink-volume-lash-system-xa0-3>Eylure ProMagnetic Magnetic Eyeliner & Faux Mink Volume Lash System&nbsp;</h2><p>The first thing I noticed about these lashes was how soft they are. They're made of faux mink, giving them the fluffiest texture of the three I tried. Plus, they’re virtually weightless; I couldn’t feel them at all once I had them on.</p><p>While the magnetic lashes did adhere to the liner without problems, I have a small qualm with the magnets themselves: Because of the location of the magnets on the lashes, the ends lift a bit, which is a dead giveaway that you're wearing false lashes. It was an easy fix, though. I cut the lashes into smaller wisps and applied them individually, which made them look more natural.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4mgtWTrLuMQZF7rtLTwWNK-1920-80.png><p>During the wind test, I did have one lash casualty, so I wouldn't say that Eylure is 100 percent windproof. However, the beauty of magnetic liner is that even if a lash or two fall off, you don't have to wear a crooked strip of falsies all night. Because the lashes stick to magnets and not a glue that will dry up, you can reposition them as many times as you need. Overall, hats off for good eyeliner and lash quality, but you might have to do a bit more work when applying them.</p><p><strong>Hana's Rating: 8/10</strong></p><a href=# data-model-name="Eylure ProMagnetic Magnetic Eyeliner & Faux Mink Volume Lash System" data-url="https://www.ulta.com/promagnetic-magnetic-eyeliner-faux-mink-volume-lash-system?productId=pimprod2009575" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?productId=pimprod2009575&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fpromagnetic-magnetic-eyeliner-faux-mink-volume-lash-system%3FproductId%3Dpimprod2009575&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=ulta.com data-merchant-id=204095 data-merchant-url=ulta.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PmFGwMPiajpZXQeReMpHp-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Eylure ProMagnetic Magnetic Eyeliner & Faux Mink Volume Lash System</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-our-verdict><span>Our Verdict</span></h2><p>Color me impressed—I definitely think magnetic lashes are the real deal. Application is super easy, the lashes stay on all day, and the lack of lash glue also means no more picking leftover clumps of the stuff out of your real lashes (or washing the gunk on your falsies before reusing them).</p><p>The liner formulas are super long-lasting—a swatch on my hand didn’t budge, even after a shower—which means you'll need <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g37351403/best-cleansing-oils/>oil-based cleanser</a> to get it off. On the flip side, because the liner formulas are thicker than average <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-liquid-eyeliners/>liquid eyeliner</a>, it’s harder to control and create a perfect line. You have to make sure to put a good amount on the innermost and outermost part of the line (don’t forget to keep cotton swabs on hand in case of mistakes).&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, I’d take all three of these over normal strip lashes any day.

Well, it’s all thanks to one magic ingredient: iron oxide. McFerran explains the ingredient is “typically used across all colored cosmetics because it creates pigment, but at a much higher level which gives it its magnetic quality.” Thanks to iron oxide, the magnets on the lashes bond to the liner to give all-day hold.&nbsp;</p><p>To apply, all you have to do is apply the magnetic liner as you normally would a traditional liquid liner. Just make sure to apply a line as thick as the magnets on the lash band, says McFerran. Then wait 20 seconds to allow the liner to dry—then either apply your false magnetic lashes or head out the door!</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-how-to-remove-magnetic-liner><span>How to Remove Magnetic Liner</span></h3><p>The one downside to magnetic liner is that it's notoriously hard to remove. McFerran suggests taking a cotton pad with micellar water and rubbing your eye until the liner comes off. I’ve personally found great success using my favorite oil-based <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g33863683/best-makeup-removers/><u>makeup remover</u></a> and gently rubbing the eyeliner away, and following that with a double cleanse. Lastly, you’ll want to gently rub off the magnetic bits from the lash magnets and place them back in their original case so they are ready to go for next time.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-expert><span>Meet the Expert</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Af8DGQ6NBTReWXTrxZ6HkV-1920-80.jpg><span class=person__name>Ann McFerran</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=LINKEDIN><span class=button-social__icon></span></a>CEO and Co-founder of Glamnetic<p>Ann attended the University of California at Los Angeles and decided to major in science as a pre-med and become a doctor.
