If you are self-employed, you are required to report your self-employment income if the amount you receive from all sources equals $400 or more.<h2>Do I have to file a 1099 if I made under $600?</h2>Yes, unless the income is considered a gift, you need to report all income that is subject to US taxation on your tax return. The $600 limit is just the IRS requirement for Form 1099-MISC to be considered necessary to file by the payer. You will report this income as other miscellaneous income on line 21 of your 1040.<h2>How can I get my W-2 without contacting my employer?</h2>If you can't get in touch with your employer to get a W-2, you can reach out to your local IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center (TAC).
