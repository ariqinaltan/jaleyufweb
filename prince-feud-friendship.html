Here's all you need to know:</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>How did Michael Jackson and Prince's feud begin?</strong></h2><figure>After his huge success with Thriller, Michael refused to consider Prince as an equal. <span class=attribution>Picture: Alamy</span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>With both artists being ultra-competitive characters, their huge success meant that they were bound to be rivals, but they were rivals from afar in the beginning.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The King Of Pop was renowned as the world's greatest entertainer, whereas The Purple One was considered to be a far greater musician.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Both being black artists who transformed what it meant to be a pop star, there were bound to be comparisons.</p><p class=paragraph-text>But Michael Jackson didn't take too kindly to that notion, reportedly revealing: "I don't like to be compared to Prince at all."</p><p class=paragraph-text>"I have proven myself since I was real little. He feels like he's my opponent. I hope he changes because, boy, he's gonna get hurt."</p><p class=paragraph-text>What started out as a professional rivalry between two generational talents quickly turned personal.</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>What happened during the infamous James Brown performance?</strong></h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/zIU8TBJ7SYU/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Michael Jackson and Prince on stage with James Brown (1983)</p><p class=paragraph-text>In what would be the first time Michael Jackson and Prince would meet, it'd also be the start of their bad blood.</p><p class=paragraph-text>In a 1983 show, <a href=#>James Brown</a> would invite both stars to perform on stage with him as they both where in attendance in the crowd.</p><p class=paragraph-text>MJ joined 'Mr. Dynamite' for a brilliant duet which drew a standing ovation from the crowd. Shortly after he encouraged Brown to get Prince up on stage too.</p><p class=paragraph-text>At the time Prince's famed paled in comparison to Michael's despite scoring hits with '1999' and 'Little Red Corvette', so he wanted to strut his stuff biggest the world's biggest stars.</p><p class=paragraph-text>But it didn't go to plan - Prince didn't manage to wow the crowd, and attempted to swing from a prop lamppost beside the stage when saw him tumble on to the floor.</p><p class=paragraph-text>In some rediscovered recordings, Jackson is heard saying: "He made a fool of himself. He was a joke…people were running and screaming. I was so embarrassed. It was all on video."</p><p class=paragraph-text>To hammer his superiority home, Jackson reportedly bought the video footage to ensure that the footage was never consigned to the history books.</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>Did Prince and Michael Jackson ever work together?</strong></h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/T9ZN9nKQqe0/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Prince Talks About Michael Jackson In 1997 www keepvid com</p><p class=paragraph-text>Despite years of bickering and competition (including a legendary ping-pong match between the two), they nearly did end up working together.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Michael wanted Prince to duet with him on 'Bad', so his producer <a href=#>Quincy Jones</a> set up a secret meeting in the summer of 1986.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Prince was clearly interested in a collaboration, but given they both artists were intense control freaks, he didn't like the fact it was billed as Jackson's project and was concerned Michael was again make him look inferior.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Michael sent Prince an early demo of 'Bad', in which Prince re-recorded virtually everything and sent it back. It didn't go down too well.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Prince would also repeatedly call Michael 'Camille' to his face and attempt to humiliate him in front of his peers.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Years later in an interview with comedian Chris Rock, Prince joked: "The first line of that song is ‘Your butt is mine’."</p><p class=paragraph-text>"Now I said, ‘Who’s gonna sing that to whom? ‘Cause you sure ain’t singing it to me. And I sure ain’t singing it to you… So right there, we got a problem."</p><p class=paragraph-text>Even though the collaboration never came to fruition and he turned down a starring role in the 'Bad' music video (which then went to Wesley Snipes), Prince reportedly turned to Jackson and his management after the meeting and graciously stated: "It will be a big hit even if I’m not on it."</p><p class=paragraph-text>For the charity single 'We Are The World', Prince also refused to contribute given that <a href=#>Lionel Richie</a> had co-wrote the song with none other than Michael Jackson.</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>Was their long-running feud heightened by the media?</strong></h2><figure>Michael Jackson called Prince "one of the rudest people I've ever met." (Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images). <span class=attribution>Picture: <a href=#>Getty</a></span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>In many ways, yes, as there's always been a desire to pit successful artists against one another even though they're not that closely related - look no further than The Beatles and <a href=#>The Rolling Stones</a> for instance.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Any sniff of a sly dig MJ or Prince would give each other the media would pounce all over it. But they both knew how to work publicity in their favour.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Michael loved to leak stories to create publicity stunts: "I want my whole career to be the greatest show on earth," he told his managers.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Though the rivalry snowballed in the media, both artists challenged each other, and they both seriously disliked each other.</p><p class=paragraph-text>In recordings for his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk, Jackson slammed Prince saying: "He was so rude, one of the rudest people I've ever met. He has been very mean and nasty to my family."</p><p class=paragraph-text>There's no smoke without fire, but ultimately it seemed that both artists had major egos that they couldn't overcome.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Even towards the end of Michael's life as he prepared for his residency at London's O2 Arena, he still had Prince at the front of his mind claiming that: "If I’m not there to receive these ideas, God might give them to Prince."</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>Did Michael Jackson and Prince ever bury the hatchet?</strong></h2><figure>After Michael Jackson's death, Prince said: "It is always sad to lose someone you loved.". <span class=attribution>Picture: Alamy</span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>Sadly, it seemed like Michael Jackson remained embattled with Prince up until his death on 25th June 2009 - ironically the 25th anniversary of Purple Rain.</p><p class=paragraph-text>In the wake of Michael's passing, everyone was keen to get Prince's perspective on his rival's demise. He made no public statement, but according to interviewers, he was deeply affected.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Author Tavis Smiley remembered talking to Prince "for hours… about his own mortality and what the loss of Michael Jackson really meant for him."</p><p class=paragraph-text>In one interview on French television, Prince simply stated: "It is always sad to lose someone you loved" and in 2014 declined to talk about it saying: "I don’t want to talk about it. I’m too close to it."</p><p class=paragraph-text>In tribute, Prince even began covering Jackson's 'Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough' when touring to the amazement of his fans.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Similarly to Michael's premature death, Prince would later die in 2016 whilst in the midst of a creative rejuvenation.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Though they clearly had disdain for one another, both Michael Jackson and Prince were more alike than they'd admit.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Sharing the same kinds of struggles and achievements, and travelling similar journeys to the top of pop music, they were both talents that defined their generation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLnOqKuhqpGZtrB6wqikaJmiqba0wNJopKKbmJayrXnJmpqkq5%2BjfLG%2ByKeanmWWmsKlecWroJ6mlKi1qryO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fprince-feud-friendship.html&text=Michael%20Jackson%20and%20Prince%27s%20feud%20explained%3a%20Why%20the%20pop%20rivals%20hated%20each%20other&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-feud-friendship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-feud-friendship.html&title=Michael%20Jackson%20and%20Prince%27s%20feud%20explained%3a%20Why%20the%20pop%20rivals%20hated%20each%20other" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fprince-feud-friendship.html&title=Michael%20Jackson%20and%20Prince%27s%20feud%20explained%3a%20Why%20the%20pop%20rivals%20hated%20each%20other" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fprince-feud-friendship.html&title=Michael%20Jackson%20and%20Prince%27s%20feud%20explained%3a%20Why%20the%20pop%20rivals%20hated%20each%20other" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-feud-friendship.html&description=Michael%20Jackson%20and%20Prince%27s%20feud%20explained%3a%20Why%20the%20pop%20rivals%20hated%20each%20other" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./vault-edition-pre-order-bonuses-content-price.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Modern Warfare 3 Vault Edition: Pre-Order Bonuses, Content, Price">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mia-goths-ethnic-wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mia Goths Ethnic Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship,Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
