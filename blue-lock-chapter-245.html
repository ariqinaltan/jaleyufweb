If you want to avoid spoilers, please skip to the next section.</p><p>Blue Lock Chapter 245 is titled “The Final Battle”. The chapter begins with Isagi and Kaiser facing off in the penalty area, with both of them determined to score the decisive goal. Isagi tries to use his meta vision to predict Kaiser’s movements, but Kaiser counters with his own meta vision and his superior physical abilities. The two strikers clash in a fierce duel, with neither of them willing to back down. Meanwhile, the other players watch in awe as they witness the clash of the two best strikers in the world.</p><p>The chapter then shifts to a flashback, where we see Kaiser’s past and how he became obsessed with soccer. We learn that Kaiser was born in Germany, but his father was a Japanese soldier who died in a war. Kaiser grew up in an orphanage, where he was bullied and discriminated by the other kids. He found solace in soccer, which he learned from watching videos of his father playing. He developed a talent for the sport, but he also developed a hatred for his opponents, whom he saw as enemies. He vowed to become the strongest striker in the world and to crush anyone who stood in his way.</p><p>The chapter then returns to the present, where we see Kaiser and Isagi still locked in a stalemate. Kaiser realizes that Isagi is the only one who can match him and that he is the only one who can understand him. He decides to end the game with his ultimate shot, which he calls “The Kaiser”. He unleashes a powerful kick that seems unstoppable, but Isagi manages to block it with his own shot, which he calls “The Isagi”. The two shots collide in a massive explosion, creating a shockwave that shakes the entire stadium. The chapter ends with a cliffhanger, as we don’t know who scored the final goal and who won the game.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=English_Spoiler_Release_Date></span><strong>English Spoiler Release Date </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The English spoiler for Blue Lock Chapter 245 is expected to be released on <strong>December 17, 2023</strong>, a day before the official release date.
